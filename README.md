# Welcome to the Devoteam Employee Management System (DEMS)

### What is this? 🤔

This is a simple and straight forward EMS, where you can keep track of your employees, or your own information

### Cool, what can I do here? 🤓

That depends on your role in the company. If you're one of our employees, you can see how many people that are hired in the company, as well as your own personal information. You can't change any information, that is the role of an admin.

If you're a manager you can see a list of all employees in the company, but you can't change any information.

If you're an admin you have all the power! Kind of, you are allowed to see all employees and edit (some) of their information.

### What do I need to do in order to see the EMS? ✏️

Glad you asked!
First you have to clone the project and then follow the instructions below

1. Run `npm i` or `npm install` in your terminal
2. Open a second terminal and run the script `server` (or if you'd rather run the whole script,
   `json-server --watch employees.json`)
3. In the first terminal, run `npm run start` to get the EMS up and going
